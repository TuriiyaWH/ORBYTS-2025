Exoplanet research project and Machine Learning with PhD students.


Developing machine learning neural networks to detect gasses in the atmospheres of exoplanets.

The types of gasses that AI will be able to detect are:

  Methane (CH4), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Water Vapour (H20), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ammonia (NH3), **Maybe:** Oxygen (O2), Phosphine (PH3)
